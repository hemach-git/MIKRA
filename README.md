# MIKRA: Manufacturing Intelligent Knowledge Routing Assistant

> **Prototype · SYNTHETIC DATA · local only.** All documents, equipment, people and numbers are fictional.

Floor supervisors ask a plain-English question. A small team of **AI agents** routes it to the right documentation (**Safety procedures, Maintenance manuals or Quality standards**, or more than one), researches each source, and returns a **grounded answer with numbered steps and citations**. Plant managers **approve document updates**, **review flagged answers** and use **query analytics** to spot recurring floor issues.

## Build status (read this first)

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| Rule-based pipeline, guardrails, document approvals, audit, analytics, feedback queue | **Built and tested** (107 automated tests; 32 rule-based evals on a mock model) |
| **LLM agents:** router, Safety / Maintenance / Quality specialists, synthesizer (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`) | **Built**, tested offline with a scripted fake LLM and formally evaluated live on 45 golden cases: **44/45 passed (97.8%)** (see Evaluation results) |
| Streamlit UI | **Built**: Ask, Documents, Review queue, Analytics, Diagnostics, plus the administrator pages *Traces & logs* and *Users & access*. Every page is smoke-tested for every role |
| Administrator tools | **Built**: stored traces for every agent step, trace view with drill-down metrics, document approve / advise / reject with diff and history, user access management with sign-in |
| Critic agent, manager insights agent, embedding search, LLM judge | Not built in this prototype. A second AI check on answers is a next step |

**Two kinds of numbers, never mixed:** the 32/32 rule-based result checks the plumbing on a mock model (no AI). The live result (44/45) is the real `gpt-4o-mini` agents on synthetic data.

**Next:** real documents from one plant line, company SSO, faster answers, a second AI check on answers.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env              # then edit it yourself
streamlit run app/main.py         # http://localhost:8501  (DB auto-seeds on first run)
```

**Sign in.** The first run creates three demo accounts (`admin`, `plant.manager`, `sup.chen`) with random passwords written to `data/initial_credentials.txt` (git-ignored; the path is also printed in the terminal and shown on the sign-in page). Set `MIKRA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to choose the administrator password. New users use *Request access* and an administrator approves them. `MIKRA_AUTH=off` turns sign-in off for local development only.

`.env` (never commit it):

```
LLM_PROVIDER=openai               # openai | anthropic | mock
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

`agents.mode` in `config.yaml` selects `multi_agent` or the rule-based `pipeline`. With `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` the app runs fully offline.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python -m pytest -q` | Unit, guardrail and service tests (isolated temp DB, no network) |
| `python -m evals.run` | Golden eval → `evals/results/latest.json` |
| `python -m app.data.seed_synthetic --reset` | Rebuild `data/mikra.db` with fresh synthetic data |
| `python scripts/render_mermaid.py` | Diagrams → `docs/img/*.png` (needs Chrome + `pip install playwright`) |
| `python scripts/make_docx.py` / `make_pptx.py` | Regenerate the .docx files and the one-page slide |

## How it works

1. **Guardrails (code):**
   - Checks the question's length and content.
   - Blocks prompt injection and requests to bypass safety controls.
   - Detects emergencies and shows the "call ext. 5555" banner.
   - Masks PII before anything is stored or logged.
2. **Router agent (LLM):** understands the question, picks the sources, extracts the equipment, flags hazards, rewrites one search query per source, and can ask a clarifying question.
3. **Hazard override (code):** keyword rules **or** the router's hazard flag always bring in the Safety specialist. A model mistake cannot drop the safety step.
4. **Specialist agents (LLM + read-only tools):** Safety, Maintenance and Quality each search only their own published manuals (max 3 steps), in parallel, and return cited findings or abstain.
5. **Synthesizer agent (LLM):** merges the findings into one structured answer, safety first.
6. **Grounding check (code):** every citation must be a retrieved section; otherwise it is dropped, and MIKRA **abstains** ("Not found in the approved documentation").
7. **Fallback (code):** an agent error, timeout or token-budget breach falls back to the rule-based pipeline.
8. **Record:** query, citations, agent trace and an audit row, plus a JSON log line (request_id, step timings, tokens, status).

**Where AI is used, and where it deliberately isn't:** the LLM does the language work (understanding, research, writing). Code owns the safety override, published-only filter, step and token caps, grounding check, approvals and audit.

## Features by user

| Floor Supervisor | Plant Manager |
|---|---|
| Ask with one-click demo questions, even in messy wording | Documents: create draft → **approve/reject** → publish (old version retired, re-indexed) |
| Safety notes first, steps, sources you can open | Review queue for flagged answers (approve/reject, audited) |
| "Not found" instead of guessing | Analytics: KPIs, daily trend, **top recurring issues**, documentation gaps, CSV export |
| Thumbs up / flag a wrong answer | Diagnostics: health, config hash, recent requests, agent trace, eval summary |

### Administrator

| Page | What an administrator can do |
|---|---|
| **Traces & logs** | Filter every question; open a trace to see the waterfall timeline and each step's input, output, tokens, latency and cost; see the citations, feedback, audit rows and log lines. Tabs for *Metrics & drill-down* (8 metrics, 8 groupings, click a row to list the questions behind it), *Agents & cost* and *Logs* |
| **Documents** | Approve, **advise changes** (send back with a comment; the author edits and resubmits), or reject. Diff against the published version and the review history |
| **Users & access** | Approve or deny access requests (choosing the role), change roles, disable accounts, reset passwords, see the access activity. The last administrator cannot be removed |

## Evaluation results

**v1 rule-based pipeline (mock LLM, synthetic data, 32 golden cases): 32/32 pass.**

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Routing accuracy | 100% | ≥ 90% |
| Correct document cited | 100% | ≥ 85% |
| Abstain correctness (out-of-scope) | 100% | 100% |
| Safety-inclusion recall (hazard tasks) | 100% | 100% |
| Draft-document leaks | 0 | 0 |
| p95 latency (pipeline, mock) | ~1 ms | < 8 s agent mode |

Case types: 15 positive, 5 multi-route (maintenance + safety), 5 negative, 7 edge (injection, emergency, draft leak, PII, bad input). Tests: **107/107 pass** (`tests/results/pytest_latest.txt`).

> ⚠️ **With the mock provider, the pass rate checks the pipeline wiring**, not AI quality. The mock is extractive and was written alongside the golden set.

**v2 agents (live `gpt-4o-mini`), formal run: 44/45 passed (97.8%)** on the 45-case golden set. Result file: `evals/results/latest_multi_agent.json` (`python -m evals.run --mode multi_agent`, 2026-11-09).

| Metric | Live result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Routing accuracy | 96.3% | ≥ 90% |
| Correct document cited | 97.1% | ≥ 85% |
| Abstain correctness (out-of-scope) | 100% | 100% |
| Safety-inclusion recall (hazard tasks) | 100% | 100% |
| Paraphrased questions | 90% (9 of 10) | ≥ 80% |
| Draft-document leaks | 0 | 0 |
| Latency p50 / p95 | 5.8 s / 10.9 s (an earlier run of the same set: 5.8 s / 8.7 s) | p95 < 8 s: **not met** |
| LLM calls and tokens per question | ~3.0 calls, ~2,000 tokens | |
| Estimated cost | ~$0.02 for the whole run (~$0.0005 per question; estimate from the price table in `evals/run.py`) | |
| Fell back to rule-based mode | 0 cases | |

By case type: paraphrase 90% (9 of 10), every other type 100%.

**The 1 failure, and 3 warnings**
- **A10** "how fast am I allowed to drive the lift truck indoors": the router asked a clarifying question instead of answering (wrong route, no citation). Fails in the first live run and the final run.
- Warnings (not failures): 2 answers mention lockout without citing the lockout procedure (E04, A05) and 1 carries an irrelevant safety note (H03).
- Fixed during the final tuning: H02 (seized roller) now cites the maintenance manual and the lockout procedure via two new code guards; P11 was a test-string mismatch (answer said "60 and 80 microns", test expected "60-80"), so the test string was corrected. Both fixes were made after seeing the failures, so the score is partly tuned on this set.

The checks are routing, citation and keyword rules, not an AI judge, and the set is synthetic and small (45 cases).

## Governance

| Item | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Config of record | `config.yaml`; its hash is stored on every `ask` audit row and in every eval result |
| Data-sources and model register | [docs/data_sources.md](docs/data_sources.md); every seeded row has `is_synthetic=1` |
| Audit trail | `audit_log` table: who, role, action, target, decision, model, request_id, details |
| Human-in-the-loop | Document publishing **requires** manager approval; flagged answers need a manager decision; **agents have read-only tools and cannot write or publish** |
| Logs | JSON lines in `logs/app.jsonl`, PII-masked |
| Stored traces | `agent_steps` table: every agent step with PII-masked input and output (clipped to 4,000 characters), tokens, latency and cost. Administrators only. A retention period is a pilot decision (risk R16) |
| Access | `users` table: salted PBKDF2 password hashes, administrator approval, lockout after 5 failed sign-ins, every decision in `audit_log` |
| Data leaving the machine | In agent mode the PII-masked question and retrieved sections go to the LLM API. Fine for synthetic data; real documents need a review first |

## Assumptions and limitations

- Sign-in is a **local prototype** (salted password hashes, lockout, administrator approval). It is not company SSO and has no multi-factor step or email password reset.
- Live quality was measured on 45 **synthetic** cases (44/45); it is not a guarantee for real documents. A small model can vary between runs, and the checks are citation and keyword based (no AI judge), so a wrong sentence that cites a real section could still pass.
- Live latency misses the 8 s goal: p50 5.8 s, p95 between 8.7 s and 10.9 s across two runs of the same set (the live API varies).
- Agent mode makes several LLM calls per question, so latency is higher than the rule-based pipeline.
- BM25 keyword search plus agent query rewriting suits ~100 sections; larger corpora need hybrid search.
- SQLite, single node, local only. Markdown documents only (no PDF/OCR yet).
