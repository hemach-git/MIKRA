# Frontend session brief: MIKRA (Manufacturing Intelligent Knowledge Routing Assistant)

You are building the **Streamlit frontend only** for MIKRA. Floor supervisors ask plain-English questions. The backend routes each question to the right documentation (Safety procedures, Maintenance manuals, Quality standards) and returns a grounded, cited answer. Plant managers update documents (draft, then approve), review flagged answers, and look at query analytics to spot recurring floor issues.

**Folder:** `C:\Users\Chepuri\mfg-doc-router`. **Branch:** same folder, `main`. Touch only frontend files and **do not commit**; the main session commits.

**You own:** `app/main.py`, `app/pages/*`, `app/ui/*`, `.streamlit/config.toml`.
**Do not edit:** `app/services/*`, `app/models/*`, `app/data/*`, `app/observability/*`, `app/config.py`, `config.yaml`, `tests/*`, `evals/*`.

The backend is **already implemented and working** (mock LLM, synthetic data). Call it; don't reimplement it. On first call it creates `data/mikra.db` and seeds synthetic data automatically.

Put this at the top of `app/main.py` so `import app.*` works when run via `streamlit run app/main.py`:
```python
import sys, pathlib; sys.path.insert(0, str(pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))
```
Pages under `app/pages/` need the same line (use `parent.parent.parent`).

## Interface contract

```python
from app.services import workflow, docs_admin, audit, analytics
from app.observability.logging import recent_logs
from app.config import get_config, model_label, config_hash

workflow.ensure_ready() -> None                       # call once at app start

workflow.health() -> dict  # status, fk_violations, llm_provider, model, config_hash, published_docs, draft_docs, chunks, queries, audit_rows, db_ms

    # raises ValueError (show st.error). New doc_key -> v1; existing -> next version. Never auto-publishes.
docs_admin.review_document(doc_id, {"decision": "approved"|"rejected", "reviewer": str, "note": str}) -> {doc_id, status, retired[]}

```

## Pages

Sidebar: MIKRA logo/title, **role selector** (Floor Supervisor / Plant Manager) and user name in `st.session_state`. Manager-only pages are hidden or disabled for supervisors. Show a persistent **"SYNTHETIC DATA - demo only"** badge and `model_label()` (it says `mock-extractive-v1` for now).

1. **Ask (home, supervisor main screen).** Big question box plus 6 one-click demo questions:
   - "How do I clear a jam on Conveyor C3?"
   - "CNC-04 spindle overheating alarm 2041"
   - "What is the torque spec for M10 bolts?"
   - "What PPE do I need in the paint booth?"
   - "There is a chemical spill near Paint Booth 1"
   - "What is the cafeteria menu today?" (shows the abstain state)

   Result layout:
   - Emergency red banner, if any.
   - **Safety notes** in a yellow warning box at the top.
   - **Routing chips**: one per category with a color (safety red, maintenance blue, quality green), confidence %, the `reason` text, and a "safety added" indicator.
   - Answer, then numbered steps.
   - **Sources**: expandable citations showing doc_key vX, section and snippet, with a button to open the full section via `get_chunk`.
   - Confidence badge.
   - Thumbs up / "Flag as wrong" with a comment, which calls `submit_feedback` and shows a success toast.
   - States: `abstained` → neutral info box with `abstain_reason`; `blocked` → warning; `error` → error box.
   - **"How MIKRA answered" expander (new, v2):** if `resp.agent_trace` is non-empty, show a compact table (step, agent, model, tokens, ms, status) and a badge for `resp.mode` ("AI agents" or "Rule-based"). If `resp.used_fallback`, show a small note, "Answered by the backup method". Hide this for supervisors on small screens if it crowds the answer.
   - **Clarifying question:** when `status == "abstained"` and `abstain_reason` ends with a question mark, show it as a prompt with a text box to reply, and re-ask with the combined text.
   - Small footer: request_id, latency, model.
   - Spinner while running. Keep a session history of the last 5 questions.
2. **Documents.**
   - Supervisors: a browsable list of published documents by category, with a viewer.
   - Managers also get:
     - Status filter.
     - A "New / update document" form: doc_key, title, category, owner, equipment, markdown content (pre-fill an example).
     - A **Pending approvals** section: diff-like side-by-side view of the draft vs the current published version, guardrail_flags warning, Approve/Reject with a note.
   - A seeded draft `QC-TORQ-01-v2` is already pending, so the demo works immediately.
3. **Review queue (manager).** Flagged answers (pending, with a tab for resolved), each with the question, category, equipment, comment and request_id, plus Confirm issue / Dismiss buttons with a note. Show an audit trail table below (filterable by action).
4. **Analytics (manager).**
   - Filters: days (7/30/90), category, equipment, include synthetic toggle.
   - 5 KPI cards: Questions, Answer rate, Safety-routed %, p95 latency, Helpful %.
   - Plain-English insights list.
   - Charts (altair):
     - Daily trend stacked by category.
     - Category breakdown.
     - **Top recurring issues** bar (equipment × category).
     - Documentation gaps table.
     - Most-cited documents.
   - Drill-down: pick equipment → table of its questions.
   - CSV download button.
   - Label it "Synthetic data, demo only" and show synthetic_share_pct.
5. **Diagnostics (manager).**
   - `health()` cards.
   - The config snapshot (`get_config()`, `config_hash()`).
   - Recent requests table from `recent_logs()`: ts, request_id, event, status, latency_ms, tokens and stage timings.
   - Error count.
   - Eval summary from `evals/results/latest.json` if it exists (else "Run `python -m evals.run`").

## Quality bar

- Professional, enterprise industrial look:
  - Sidebar navigation (`st.navigation`/`st.Page` or `pages/`).
  - Consistent theme in `.streamlit/config.toml`: dark slate primary, safety orange accent.
  - Cards via `st.container(border=True)` and `st.metric`.
- Clear spinners, error/success states and empty states.
- Plain English for supervisors, with no jargon like "BM25" on the Ask page.
- Must be usable on a tablet width.

## Rules

- Use port **8501**. The main session checked it's free. Run `streamlit run app/main.py --server.port 8501 --server.headless true` and verify **each page** loads with no exceptions, including asking each demo question and doing one approve and one feedback.
- Report what you verified. Never hardcode keys. Don't commit.
